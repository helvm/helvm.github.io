# ✔️ TODO

**Planned features**:

1. Add Malbolge - We have Haskell version. We have to do it because it is simple
2. Implement Scheme - We have two simple Haskell version. We need it for next steps
3. Implement Asm for Combinators:
   1. Implement Lazier - Schema DSL. 
   2. Implement Scheme Like Lazier  - For all functional language
   3. Implement MCL - For all functional language
4. Implement other Eso-Schemes:
   1. Implement Unlambda-Scheme to Unlambda. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 4 types
   2. Implement Funge-Scheme to Funge. It is hard because code is in CL. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 2 types
5. Compile Scheme to:
   1. WASM
   2. SICP-Asm
   3. ELVM
6. Compile ELVM to WASM and SICP-Asm
7. Compile WASM and SICP-Asm to MCL
8. Implement imperative assemblers and automata
   1. Piet. It is hard because IO
   2. Malbolge-Asm. These are many Malbolge-Asm, but all in C
   3. Funge. These are many fungus, but asm does not exists
9. Compile C - It is the last goal 
   
You can propose feature by [GitHub](https://github.com/helvm/helcam/issues).
But if there is a reference code ih Haskell, the feature goes up
