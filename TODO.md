# ✔️ TODO

**Required features.**

1. Add Malbolge - We have Haskell version. We have to do it because it is simple
2. Implement Scheme - We have two simple Haskell version. We need it for next steps
3. Implement Lazier - Schema DSL. 
4. Implement Scheme Like Lazier - For all functional language
5. Compile Scheme to:
    1. WASM
    2. SICP-Asm
    3. ELVM
6. Compile ELVM to WASM and SICP-Asm
7. Compile WASM and SICP-Asm to MCL
8. Implement Eso-Scheme:
    1. Implement Unlambda-Scheme to Unlambda. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 4 types
    2. Implement Funge-Scheme to Funge. It is hard because code is in CL. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 2 types
9. Implement Piet. It is hard because IO
