# 📐 ARCHITECTURE

We have Spaghetti ARCHITECTURE inspired by Flying Spaghetti Monster.
We have six diffrent projects. And fix ways to parse code.

| Project | Parser | Direct objects | Indirect objects|
| ---     | ---    | --- | --- |
| **[HelMA](http://helvm.org/helma)** | ReadP             | Collect Legacy Automata | Create common Stack Automaton |
| **[HelPA](http://helvm.org/helpa)** | AttoParsec        | Collect Legacy Assemblers | Create common Stack Assembler |
| **[HelCT](http://helvm.org/helct)** | Happy Alex        | Build esoteric C Compiler  | Collect C library |
| **[HelTC](http://helvm.org/heltc)** | Trifecta          | Build functional Language for Lambda Calculus | Collect algoritms, macros library and combinators |
| **[HelPS](http://helvm.org/helps)** | haskell-src / Own | Build self hosted Haskell | Compile Haskell to Esoteric Languages |
| **[HelMS](http://helvm.org/helms)** | MegaParsec        | Build real Scheme in Haskell | Run Scheme in Esoteric Language |

## Style

| Procjects | HelMA, HelPA, HelCT | HelTC, HelPS, HelMS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Style | Declaration | Expression |
| Application and composition | Normal (Right-to-left ) | Reversed (Left-to-right)|
| do notation | don't use | use |
| Language extensions | use all | try not to use it |
| Will we prescribe? | Maybe Rust? |No, we can not! |
