# 🛣️ ROADMAP

**Required features.**

1. Add Malbolge - We have Haskell version. We have to do it because it is simple
2. Implement Scheme - We have two simple Haskell version. We need it for next steps
3. Implement Lazier - Schema DSL. 
4. Implement Scheme Like Lazier - For all functional language
5. Compile Scheme to:
  1. WASM
  2. SICP-Asm
  3. ELVM
5. Implement SICP-Scheme to SICP-Scheme-Asm (SCIP)
6. Implemnet SICP-Scheme-Asm to macros in MetaLambda Calculus.
7. Implement Unlambda-Scheme to Unlambda. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 4 types
8. Implement Funge-Scheme to Funge. It is hard because code is in CL. It is a litle dynamic. Scheme has 2 types
9. Implement Piet. It is hard because IO
