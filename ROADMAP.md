**Required features.**

1. Add Malbolge - we have Haskell version. We have to do it because it is simple
2. Implement Scheme - we have two simple Haskell version. We need it for next steps
3. Implement Lazier - Schema DSL. 
4. Implement Scheme Like Lazier. For all functional language
5. Implement Scheme to Scheme-Asm
6. Implemnet Scheme-Asm to macros in MetaLambda Calculus.
7. Implement Scheme to Unlambda
8. Implement Scheme to Funge. It is hard because code is in CL
9. Implement Piet. It is hard because IO
